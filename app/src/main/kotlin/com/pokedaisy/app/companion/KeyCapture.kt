/**
 * GAME BUTTONS / HOTKEYS rebinding by pressing the keys themselves - never by picking a key's name from a list.
 * One of these per activity: the top-screen Settings, first-time setup (the library) and the game, which runs the
 * companion's (its Presentation never gets keys: every key goes to the game's activity, and the game's screen
 * shows what to press, [com.pokedaisy.app.companion.ui.KeyCapturePopup]).
 *
 * While a [Request] waits, every key goes here and nowhere else - not the game, the hotkeys or the UI's focus -
 * and so do the analog triggers ([onTriggers], L2 / R2 as their keys). Once every key pressed is let go the
 * request ends with them: a hotkey takes them all (a chord), a GBA button the first. BACK cancels. A key already
 * down when the capture began only counts once pressed again (its release - often the A that opened the row -
 * ends nothing), and a key still held when a capture ends keeps its release here, so nothing sees half a press.
